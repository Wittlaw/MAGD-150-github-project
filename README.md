# MAGD-150-github-project
3 Assignments from MAGD 150
# Lab 2
The second lab project, a simple "button" that would activate under one condition, if a button press = true
# Lab 3
The third lab project was a bit more complicated. It was supposed to be a ball that would follow the mouse and would change colors as it did so, but the code did not work properly.
# Lab 7
##### Lab 7 works as intended.
Lab 7 was a glowing orb (a will 'o wisp) that would move through "trees" while following the mouse.
